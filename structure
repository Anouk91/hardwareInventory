1. INTRODUCTION

motivation
 - describe security issues regarding IPv6

problem

solution

scope 
  ubuntu

2. LITERATURE STUDY
What are the possibilties regarding the different circumstances

  1 active IPv6 address 
	brows IPv6 NDP cache for MAC --> look in all switches for this MAC
  2 inactive IPv6 address
	statefull autoconf: look in DHCPv6 log and hope the DUID is the MAC address
	stateless autoconf: when ff:fe --> EUI-64 address --> MAC is in IPv6 address
		privacy extension useless unless
			1 webserver logged user name with IPv6 address
			2 Access Control List (ACL) with log-input keyword ro IPv6 + MAC
 


3. PROOF OF CONCEPT
usecase:
 1 each node in the network has one IPv4 and one stateless IPv6 
 
automate  MAC tracing through IPv6 address


4. FUTURE WORK
 - discover rogue router devices

5. DISCUSSION
interface eth1
{
   AdvSendAdvert on;
   prefix 2001:db8:e00:429::/64
   {
   };
};
